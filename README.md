###All practice is not created equal

Ander Ericcson orginally coined the term the 10,000 hours. The concept was born out of a study of 30 piano players who accumulated 10,000 in their pursuit of expert performance. The concept is it takes 10,000 hours of "deliberate practice" to achieve master in an given field. This concept was later adopted by Malcolm Gladwell in the New York Times best seller "Outlier: The story of success". After much criticism over the simpilisticity of the rule a new study was published to replicate the orginal study to confirm there is a correlation in solo deliberatde practice and expert performance.
The replication study ask Violinist at different levels of expertise how many hours they engaged in solo practice and teacher guided practice. This project will explore similities and difference in practice type of different level of Violinist performance.
The study did not replicate Ander Ericcson original study. 
Summary:

The graph showing the accumulated  number of hours studied alone and teacher guided shows there's no quantitaive difference in studied hours amount the professional, best and good violinist groups. The less accomplished group only practice 7800 hours compared to the 14000 hours of the professional group. More practice does have positive impact on performance but only up to a point. After that threshold is met. The real question is what qualitive factors did the professional group possess during their practice that made it more effective which is evident in their professional violinist status.

The majority of violinst in this dataset started playing the violin by the age of six. The age range of the best, good, less accomplished are around the age of 18-25. The professional age range is 27-54.
It should be noted this is a small sample size. There are 13 best violinst, 13 good violinist, 13 less accomplished violinist and four professional violinist in this dataset.
The best and good violinst decided to become professional volinist around the age of twelve. The less accomplished and the professional at around the age of seventeen.
The years practiced was signicantly different due to the age of the professional group. The range of years practiced in the professional group was around 24- 47 years of practiced. With the others groups averaging around 10-20 years of practice.
The best group lead the number of competition at a median of 10. The good and the professional group's median was 8 and 7 respectively. With the less accomplished median at 1.

There was a quantitative difference in practice hours between the less accomplished group and the rest. Thus practicing more was required to move from the less accomplished group to the good, best and professional group. The good, best and professional group all practiced similar amounts of time. Practicing more initially had a positive effect on performance. After that threshold was met the quality of the practice matter more. All practice is not created equal.
